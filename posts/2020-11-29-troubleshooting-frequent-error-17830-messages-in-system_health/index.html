			<p>While analyzing the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/extended-events/use-the-system-health-session?view=sql-server-ver15">system_health</a> on a few SQL Servers, I noticed that error 17830 is logged about 30 times every minute, and this behavior is consistent across a set of servers. After doing some googling, I came across <a href="https://bobsql.com/sql-mysteries-why-is-my-sql-server-experiencing-lots-of-17830-tcp-10054-errors/">a very detailed writeup about this error on bobsql.com</a>. This post saved me quite a bit of troubleshooting time as it explained the details behind what may cause this error and a potential fix.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, I setup a custom extended event session so I can easily monitor for this error message, and see if I can make it go away.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>With this monitoring in place, I was able to get some details about the clients (they all seemed to be coming from localhost) as well as a pattern in the error message, it was either:
<code>Network error code 0x2746 occurred while establishing a connection; the connection has been closed. This may have been caused by client or server login timeout expiration. Time spent during login: total 3 ms, enqueued 3 ms, network writes 0 ms, network reads 0 ms, establishing SSL 0 ms, network reads during SSL 0 ms, network writes during SSL 0 ms, secure calls during SSL 0 ms, enqueued during SSL 0 ms, negotiating SSPI 0 ms, network reads during SSPI 0 ms, network writes during SSPI 0 ms, secure calls during SSPI 0 ms, enqueued during SSPI 0 ms, validating login 0 ms, including user-defined login processing 0 ms. [CLIENT: ::1]</code></p>
<p>Or:
<code>Network error code 0x2746 occurred while establishing a connection; the connection has been closed. This may have been caused by client or server login timeout expiration. Time spent during login: total 1 ms, enqueued 1 ms, network writes 0 ms, network reads 0 ms, establishing SSL 0 ms, network reads during SSL 0 ms, network writes during SSL 0 ms, secure calls during SSL 0 ms, enqueued during SSL 0 ms, negotiating SSPI 0 ms, network reads during SSPI 0 ms, network writes during SSPI 0 ms, secure calls during SSPI 0 ms, enqueued during SSPI 0 ms, validating login 0 ms, including user-defined login processing 0 ms. [CLIENT: 127.0.0.1]</code></p>
<p>The the only difference between the repeated 2 messages was the client IP: <code>127.0.0.</code> or <code>::1</code>. Both these IPs are the loopback adapter (aka localhost) with the former being IPv4 and the latter IPv6. At this point, my guess was that a client was using <code>localhost</code> as the server name, and it was resolving to both <code>127.0.0.</code> and <code>::1</code>, trying to connect to both, and dropping the &ldquo;loser&rdquo;. I was not able to get more details from the extended event - probably because a lot of this was happening before authentication took place, however I had narrowed down the search to what is running on the server itself.</p>
<p>At this point I could have captured all logins and tried to see a pattern, but I took a guess and assumed this is caused by <code>Telegraf Data Collector</code> which we use on all the servers for gathering metrics (for more details on this, please see this <a href="https://tracyboggiano.com/archive/series/collecting-performance-metrics/">set of excellent blog posts by Tracy Boggiano</a> or her <a href="https://github.com/tboggiano/grafana">GitHub repo</a>)</p>
<p>Sure enough, the connection string it was using turned out to be <code>Server=localhost;Port=1433;app name=telegraf;log=1;</code>. Changing this to use <code>127.0.0.1</code> instead to default to IPv6 as: <code>Server=127.0.0.1;Port=1433;app name=telegraf;log=1;</code> and restarting the service resolved the issue and the regular 17830 errors we no more.</p>
<p>Once done, I used the following code to clean up my testing XE Session:</p>

</code></pre></div>
